                    My name is Niousha Jafari. Some people call me NJ. My Starbucks name is Alex.
                    <li>I'm a Mobile and Web developer.</li>
                    <li>I'm trying to learn the Piano but my progress so far has been ordering a keyboard and unwrapping it.</li>
                    <li>I find cooking appalling so I have to eat out most of the time with friends and call it socializing because I'm an extrovert.</li>
                    <li>Learning new languages fascinates me so I spend a good amount of time trying to learn new alphabets and languages.</li>
                    <li> I speak English and Farsi (spoken in Iran) fluently, I'm working on Spanish, and trying to pick up Czech, French, and German.</li>
                    <li>I've lived in Tehran, Prague, Bilbao (funny story about that), and currently Boston.</li>
                    <li>I spend most of my money on food, travel, and my IRA.</li>
