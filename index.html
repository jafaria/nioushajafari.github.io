                    <li>I'm trying to learn the Piano but my progress so far has been ordering a keyboard and unwrapping it.</li>
                    <li>I eat out with friends most nights to 'socialize' because I'm an 'extrovert'; but the truth is I just find cooking appalling.</li>
                    <li>Learning new languages fascinates me and I spend a good amount of time trying to learn new alphabets.</li>
                    <li>I speak English and Farsi (spoken in Iran) fluently, I'm working on Spanish, and am trying to pick up Czech, French, and German.</li>
                    <li>I've lived in Tehran, Prague, Bilbao (funny story about that), and currently Boston.</li>
